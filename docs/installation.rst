Installation
############

MultiColoc requires (at least) Python 3.6 with the packages `PyQt5`, `skimage` and `numpy`. Any dependencies should install automatically, should you install these packages with pip.

For Windows, Python can be unintuitive to set up. A installer is available for ease of use, available at:

https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ChrisK91/multicoloc/build/artifacts

Running from source
-------------------

If you download the entire repository, you can run MultiColoc from source, via `python run.py` inside the project directory.

Crashes and errors
------------------

If you experience crashes on Windows, you can find a log in your `%appdata%` folder, containing a python error message.
